=============== Good ==================
1) Use of object destructuring
2) arrow function

=============== Need improvement ==================
1) Component naming should be intuitive
Ex : 1) UserData component should have name ListUsers
     2) UserModal should have name AddUser
2) Add error handling and show errors in UI for axios request and other places
3) addFirstName method is too confusing/wrong, It should be handleInputChange or onInputChange
4) Use object destructuring everywhere
5) Form in modal is not well formed, It should look nice like shown in antd docs
6) Select dropdown in add form should be same with as other elements in form so it looks nice
7) Add widths to table columns so they dont seem fluctuating while page change
